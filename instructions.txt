1. Edit the backSlider css file and add your slide locations:

.slide_1 { background-image: url('images/slide1.jpg'); }
.slide_2 { background-image: url('images/slide2.jpg'); }
.slide_3 { background-image: url('images/slide3.jpg'); }
.slide_4 { background-image: url('images/slide4.jpg'); }

You can have as many as you want

2. Change the .slide and .slider classes and change the height to the height of your div

3. Add <div id="slider" class="slider"></div> to your HTML file
4. Include the js and css backSlider files in your HTML file.
5. Include jQuery as this is also required
6. Call the backSlider function

    <script>
	backSlider.init('slider',4);
    </script>

The number "4" needs to reflect the number of slides you have otherwise it will only show the number you have placed.. if you have .slide_1, .slide_2.... .slide_20... but only put in 3.. it will only show slide 1 to 3
